I'm currently a postdoc at the Institute of High Energy Physics and the China Center of Advanced Science and Technology. I got my Ph.D degree from the Institute of High Energy Physics in 2023, supervised by Prof. Hai-Bo Li. After my graduation, I was awarded the BESIII Ph.D Thesis Award for my contribution to the collaboration.

I'm a member of the international collaboration BESIII, working on hyperon physics.

Below are some photos of me:
